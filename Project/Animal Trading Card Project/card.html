			<p>A giraffe's neck is too short to reach the ground. As a result, it has to awkwardly spread its front legs or kneel to reach the ground for a drink of water.Giraffes only need to drink once every few days. Most of their water comes from all the plants they eat.Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up.</p>
